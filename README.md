# Livepeer.com API Demo

This is a demo app to showcase how to use Livepeer.com APIs to create a live stream and play with JWPlayer. The app enables the user to create a stream and play it back via JWPlayer while tracking video analytics which can be accessed on the JWPlayer Dashboard.

**Note: To start a video stream, please use a broadcaster software like OBS/Streamyard on desktop, or Larix on mobile**

The demo app uses POST [/stream](https://livepeer.com/docs/guides/api/create-a-stream) endpoint to create a new stream.
